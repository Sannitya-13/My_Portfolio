My Awesome Portfolio
üëã Hello there! Welcome to my awesome portfolio. This repository showcases my projects, skills, and achievements. Feel free to explore and get to know me better.

üìÅ Project Directory
Here's a quick overview of the projects you'll find in this repository:

Public Bicycle Rental System with Regression Comparison: This project compares different regression algorithms for predicting demand in a public bicycle rental system. Using Python, the project implements and evaluates various regression algorithms and identifies the LGBM Regressor as the best performer. The system is deployed with a user-friendly interface using Tkinter and Gradio.

E-Learning Platform using HTML, CSS, JS, and Node.js: In this project, I developed an e-learning platform using a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js. The platform provides a user-friendly interface for accessing and participating in online courses. It includes features such as course enrollment, progress tracking, multimedia content delivery, and discussion forums.

Telegram Chat Bot with Firebase Integration: This project involves creating a Telegram chat bot using the Telegram API and a JSON file for handling user requests. The bot is integrated with Firebase to store and retrieve data. It allows users to interact with the bot, perform various actions, and retrieve information through a conversational interface.

Futoshiki Puzzle Solver in Python: In this project, I implemented a simple Futoshiki puzzle solver using Python. The program takes an input puzzle and uses logical rules to solve it. The solver provides a solution for the given puzzle, allowing users to enjoy playing Futoshiki puzzles without the need for manual solving.
